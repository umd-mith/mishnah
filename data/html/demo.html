    <h2>About This Demo</h2>
    <p> The <a class="highlighted" href="http://www.digitalmishnah.umd.edu/">Digital Mishnah
            Project</a> will provide users with a database of digitized manuscripts of the Mishnah
        from around the world, along with tools for collation, comparison, and analysis. This demo
        provides fully marked up transcriptions of several major witnesses of tractate
            <i>Neziqin</i> (<i>Bava Qamma</i>, <i>Bava Metsi'a</i>, and <i>Bava Batra</i>), and
        illustrates basic functionalities. In addition the transcribed witnesses include several
        Genizah fragments, with an emphasis on those fragments that join other fragments to make up
        larger manuscripts</p>
    <p>Manuscript witnesses are referred to by the catalog number in the Sussmann <i>Thesaurus</i>
        (S+0+Sussmann no.). Printed editions are provisionally given serial numbers.</p>

                <td>The <a class="highlighted" href="compare">compare</a> function allows for the
                    detailed comparison of witnesses. At its core it runs a set of texts through <a
                        href="http://www.collatex.net/">CollateX</a>, which aligns matching words
                    ("tokens"). The Digital Mishnah site remerges this output with the original
                    textual data and represents the results both as an alignment table, and as a
                    text with critical apparatus. The user can determine the passage, the witnesses,
                    and the order. Because we anticipate that a number of users will prefer a
                    parallel-column ("synoptic") presentation, the collate page shows an arrangement
                    of the selected passage arranged in parallel columns by witness in the
                    user-specified order. Note: The previous version of this set of functions is at
